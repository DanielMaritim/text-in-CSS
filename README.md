Text can be changed using CSS in many ways.The color can be changed using the color property.It can use either the hex value,the rgb value or the color name.

One can also change text alignment using the text alignment property,text can be aligned in the center,right or left or justified using the justify value where each text Justifying extends each line of your text to the left and right margins. Justifying text might make the last line of text in a paragraph considerably shorter than the other lines.This uses the:text-align property

Text decoration is used to put or remove text decoration on the text.It also helps remove underline from links.Text decoration has none.line-through,overline or underline values.It uses the:text-decoration property

Text transformation is used to make small or uppercases in a text and can even capitalize the first letter of each word

Text Indentation is used to indent text.The word indent is used to describe the distance, or number of blank spaces used to separate a paragraph from the left or right margins.Dont confuse this with text alignment.It uses the:text-indent prpoerty

The letter-spacing property is used to specify the amount of specing inbetween the letters/characters
